# ✈️ Flight Status Prediction  

Predict whether a flight will be **on-time** or **delayed** using historical airline data, passenger details, and flight attributes. This project demonstrates the complete **machine learning workflow** — from data preprocessing to model deployment-ready predictions.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Flight delays are costly for airlines and frustrating for passengers. This project uses **machine learning** to analyze flight data and predict flight status, allowing for proactive decision-making and improved customer experience.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset contains information such as:  
- Passenger demographics (Gender, Age, Nationality)  
- Flight details (Airport Name, Arrival Airport, Country, Continent)  
- Flight schedule (Month, Day)  
- Target variable: `Flight_Status` (On-time / Delayed)  

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Converting dates to numerical features  
  - Renaming and cleaning columns  
- **EDA:**  
  - Visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib  
  - Insights into delay patterns by airport, country, and month  
- **Model Training:**  
  - Classification models to predict `Flight_Status`  
  - Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- **Evaluation:**  
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Plotly** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment  

## 📊 Results  
The final model achieves **high accuracy** in predicting flight status, showing strong potential for real-world airline operations and passenger information systems.
